# LinkedList Mod 3 version
This was a one-day project where I was to take any project of my choice that I had completed in Mod 1 of Turing and 
do it again, this time as a one-day solo project instead of a paired week-long project. 

## Description 
LinkedList stores website bookmarks that the user supplies through a form. Bookmarks can be deleted or marked as read.
